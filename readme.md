## toolA

The directory trees corresponding to the subfolders under toolA are (take `and` as an example):

```shell
.
├── candidates 					
├── data
├── fail
├── fat-results
├── fat-results_backup
├── i2c.faults
└── i2c_modified.bench
```

* **candidates**: Candidate files generated by toolA. The number in the file name corresponds to the serial number of the fault in the faults file
* **data**: Neighborhood data extracted from the `fat-results` folder according to candidate files 
* **fail**: Fail data files in toolA format after fault simulation 
* **fat-results**: Simulation result files of `i2c_modified.bench`
* **fat-results_backup**: Simulation result files of `i2c.bench`
* **i2c.faults**: Fault file under the current fault type
* **i2c_modified.bench**: The i2c circuit file after inserting the neighborhood under the current fault type

## toolB

The directory trees corresponding to the subfolders under toolB are (take `and` as an example):

```shell
.
├── candidates
├── data
├── diagnosis_report
├── fat-results
├── fat-results_backup
├── i2c.faults
├── i2c_modified.bench
└── tmax_fail
```

* **candidates**: Candidate files extracted from the `diagnosis_report` folder
* **data**: Neighborhood data extracted from the `fat-results` folder according to candidate files 
* **diagnosis_report**: Diagnosis result files generated by toolB
* **fat-results**: Simulation result files of `i2c_modified.bench`
* **fat-results_backup**: Simulation result files of `i2c.bench`
* **i2c.faults**: Fault file under the current fault type
* **i2c_modified.bench**: The `i2c` circuit file after inserting the neighborhood under the current fault type
* **tmax_fail**: Fail data files in toolB format after fault simulation
