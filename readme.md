# **数据部分**

The `i2c` folder is the original data set. The directory tree of `i2c` is

```shell
.
├── i2c.bench
├── i2c.test
├── i2c.v
├── osu035_stdcells.v
├── toolA
└── toolB
```

* **i2c.bench**: The circuit file in the banch format of `i2c`
* **i2c.test**: test pattern file in toolA format
* **i2c.stil**: test pattern file in toolB format
* **i2c.v**: `i2c` circuit file using `osu035` standard library
* **osu035_stdcells.v**: `osu035` standard library file
* **toolA**: Original data generated by toolA
* **toolB**: Original data generated by toolB

Original data set is divided into 2 folders: `toolA` and `toolB`, corresponding to the data sets generated by the two tools. Each folder has 6 subfolders: `ssl`, `msl`, `and`, `or`, `dom` and `fe`, which represent the corresponding fault types respectively. 

**Note**: `and` represents `and bridge fault`, `or` represents `or bridge fault`, `dom` represents `dom bridge fault`, and `fe` represents `input pattern fault`



## toolA

The directory trees corresponding to the subfolders under toolA are (take `and` as an example):

```shell
.
├── candidates 					
├── data
├── fail
├── fat-results
├── fat-results_backup
├── i2c.faults
└── i2c_modified.bench
```

* **candidates**: Candidate files generated by toolA. The number in the file name corresponds to the serial number of the fault in the faults file
* **data**: Neighborhood data extracted from the `fat-results` folder according to candidate files 
* **fail**: Fail data files in toolA format after fault simulation 
* **fat-results**: Simulation result files of `i2c_modified.bench`
* **fat-results_backup**: Simulation result files of `i2c.bench`
* **i2c.faults**: Fault file under the current fault type
* **i2c_modified.bench**: The i2c circuit file after inserting the neighborhood under the current fault type

## toolB

The directory trees corresponding to the subfolders under toolB are (take `and` as an example):

```shell
.
├── candidates
├── data
├── diagnosis_report
├── fat-results
├── fat-results_backup
├── i2c.faults
├── i2c_modified.bench
└── tmax_fail
```

* **candidates**: Candidate files extracted from the `diagnosis_report` folder
* **data**: Neighborhood data extracted from the `fat-results` folder according to candidate files 
* **diagnosis_report**: Diagnosis result files generated by toolB
* **fat-results**: Simulation result files of `i2c_modified.bench`
* **fat-results_backup**: Simulation result files of `i2c.bench`
* **i2c.faults**: Fault file under the current fault type
* **i2c_modified.bench**: The `i2c` circuit file after inserting the neighborhood under the current fault type
* **tmax_fail**: Fail data files in toolB format after fault simulation
